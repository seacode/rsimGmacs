# rsimGmacs
R-based simulator for testing gmacs (take 2).

Currently, the function 'runSim.BBRKC()' runs the R-based gmacs simulation model in a simple demonstration mode based on the model configuration provided by ModelConfiguration.BBRKC() [2 fisheries, 2 surveys, found in ModelConfiguration.R]. Plots are produced of various population quantities, but no output is otherwise provided. Output suitable for input to gmacs is TBD at the moment.
