# rsimGmacs
R-based simulator for testing gmacs (take 2).

The function 'runSim.BBRKC()' runs the R-based gmacs simulation model in a simple demonstration mode based on the model configuration file ModelConfiguration.BBRKC.dat [2 fisheries, 2 surveys, multiple time blocks]. Plots are produced of various population quantities. Currently, no output is otherwise provided. Output suitable for input to gmacs will be implemented as the next step in development.

Comments from gmacs developers/users are welcome and invited.
